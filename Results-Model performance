📊 Model Performance (Random Forest on Weather Data)

After training the Random Forest model and adjusting the classification threshold to 0.3, the following results were obtained on the test dataset:

🔢 Confusion Matrix
	           Predicted: No Drought	Predicted: Drought
Actual: No	          671	               28

📈 Performance Metrics

Accuracy: 72.5%

Balanced Accuracy: 72.6%

Kappa: 0.2287

P-value [Accuracy > No Information Rate]: 1

Mcnemar’s Test P-value: < 2e-16

🧠 Interpretation

The model performs well at identifying No Drought conditions (high precision), but struggles with Drought due to class imbalance.

SMOTE was used to synthetically balance the training data, helping improve detection of the minority "Drought" class.

Lower precision and recall for drought indicates room for improvement—this could be addressed by tuning the threshold further, collecting more data, or using different algorithms.
